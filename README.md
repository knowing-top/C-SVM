# Purpose:
This project is distributed in the hope that it will be useful for people who want to learn about the compiler's work, such as lexical analysis, grammatical analysis, semantic analysis, and the execution of a stack-based virtual machine.
Specifically, this program provides a stack-based virtual machine that can interpret the execution of a C-like language, along with its instruction set.
The program consists of two main components: the kernel part and the IDE user interface.
The Compiler part is implemented using C++.
The IDE is developed using C#.

# Structure:
### app
Contains the executable program, ensuring you can quickly scan through it.
Highlights:
The DEMOS folder contains some examples you can use at the beginning.
Refer to the "User Guide.pdf" in the doc folder for some useful guides.

### doc
Contains two documents detailing the C-SVM language and IDE usage.

### src
Contains the source code for both the Compiler and IDE.
