MSCT：A C-Like educational compiler.

Purpose:
This project is distributed in the hope that it will be useful for people who want to learn about the compiler's work, such as lexical analysis, grammatical analysis, semantic analysis, and the execution of a stack-based virtual machine.
Specifically, this program provides a stack-based virtual machine that can interpret the execution of a C-like language, along with its instruction set.
The program consists of two main components: the kernel part and the IDE user interface.
The Compiler part is implemented using C++.
The IDE is developed using C#.

Structure:
app
Contains the executable program, ensuring you can quickly scan through it.
Highlights:
The DEMOS folder contains some examples you can use at the beginning.
Refer to the "User Guide.pdf" in the doc folder for some useful guides.

doc
Contains two documents detailing the MSCT language and IDE usage.

src
Contains the source code for both the Compiler and IDE.


在使用本程序之前，请先阅读关于本程序的CPYYING

目的：
本项目是对那些对编译器词法分析、语法分析、语义分析以及栈式虚拟机执行过程感兴趣的人提供帮助或者借鉴。特别的本程序给出了一种栈式虚拟机能够解释的执行类c语言，并给出了该虚拟机的指令。
本程序由MSCT类c语言Compiler部分和IDE用户界面两部分组成，其中
Compiler部分使用C++语言实现，IDE使用C#语言实现。

项目结构如下：
 app ---可执行程序。方便你对程序的了解，其中DEMOS文件夹下有部分例子，在使用之前请先查看doc文件夹下的User Guide.pdf文件。
 doc ---关于MSCT编译语言的说明以及IDE的使用。
 src ---Compiler以及IDE的全部源代码。
